1)
a) because MAXCHEESE is a final variable, it cannot be re assigned and therefore will give a compile time error.
b) the data type of names is strings, the data type of amounts and prices are doubles
c) the amount of entries is going to equal MAXCHEESE
d) the statements for names and prices would be valid as long as index 3 exists. the statement for names would not be valid as it is being assigned with the incorrect data type
e) the outputs would be:
Cheese A10
Cheese A10
cheese 6510
Cheese K
Cheese 75
2) I didn't really copy anything from the previous lab because i wanted to redesign my code
3) I copied the entire fixed error.java 
4) I used 6 loops
5) I used for loops and while loops
