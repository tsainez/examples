1) the return types of the sumAll methods are long 
2) max has to be < the value of arr.length().
3) The return types of the squareSum methods are also long 
4) init(arr) sets all of the values of the array to zero so that we may use the zeros to avoid repetetive computation
5) The return types of the fib methods are long
6) the Fibonacci output starts at 2 because to calculate the next number in the sequence two predefined terms are needed.
7) The return types of the factorial methods are longs
8) the factorial output starts at two because to calculate the next number in the sequence you need towo predefined terms to multiply together.
9) arr is declared as a long because it will hold values that excede the scope of an int, so declaring as long helps to avoid overflow.
10) the program runs up until sumAll(arr, 10) is called. because arr[10] does not exist.
