1) I used 7 variables not including the Scanner object
2) I used doubles and integers (again not including the scanner object).
3) Variables that were going to have to hold values that would be between whole numbers such as price or half pounds would have to be
doubles, everything else that would end up being a whole number could be declared as an integer.
4) the print function is going to output to the console and will end on the same line that it started on.
println will end the print statement with a new line
5)Yes I used both print and println. print is better when prompting user input because the cursor is going to be on the same line as the prompt
println is going to be better for displaying non prompt lines because it helps with format
6) the line System.out.println(); is going to begin a newline
