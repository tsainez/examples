    <h1>AAVE</h1>

    <p>
      It is unusual for a policy announcement at a city school-board meeting to
      trigger a worldwide media frenzy, but one California school-board meeting
      in December 1996 did exactly that. Within days of the announcement,
      school-board members could not leave their homes without being besieged by
      journalists. They were vilified, ridiculed, and attacked in newspapers and
      magazines around the entire world. What had happened?
    </p>

    <p>
      The board had issued a statement to the effect that it was changing its
      educational policies with regard to one aspect of the local linguistic
      situation. They would pay more serious attention to the language spoken at
      home by most of the district’s school students. Its status would be
      recognized, teachers would be trained to look at it objectively and
      appreciate its merits, and it would be used in the classroom as
      appropriate. This much was reported by the

      <em>New York Times</em> quite accurately and fairly. Yet opinion writers
      proceed to fall upon the topic like starving dogs attacking a bone. They
      ridiculed, they sneered, they frothed, they flamed, they raged, they lived
      off the story for weeks. The talk-radio switchboards lit up, and the
      intemperate opinions flared. What was going on?<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer lies in the fact that the language being recognized by the
      school board was not Spanish or Polish or Russian or any such relatively
      uncontroversial language. The city was Oakland, a poor city on the east
      side of San Francisco Bay where half the population is African American,
      and the language was one that linguists usually call African American
      Vernacular English (AAVE).
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes AAVE so dramatically different as a political issue from, say,
      Spanish (also spoken in Oakland, by up to a quarter of the population) is
      its close relation to another language of much higher prestige. Most
      speakers of Standard English think that AAVE is just a badly spoken
      version of their language, marred by a lot of ignorant mistakes in grammar
      and pronunciation, or worse than that, an unimportant and mostly abusive
      repertoire of street slang used by an ignorant urban underclass. An
      editorial in the <em>New York Times</em> a few days after the first news
      report said that the Oakland school board had “declared that black slang
      is a distinct language.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me begin by getting that myth out of the way. The <em>Times</em>’s
      statement about slang was completely untrue, and the writers should be
      ashamed of themselves. So should all the newspapers and magazines that
      followed them. The governing board of the Oakland Unified School District
      never mentioned slang and never intended to imply anything approving about
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We call an expression slang when it represents a vivid, colloquial word or
      phrase associated with some subculture not yet incorporated as part of the
      mainstream language. No subculture’s slang could constitute a separate
      language. The mistake is like confusing a sprinkle of hot sauce with a
      dinner. Slang is by definition parasitic on some larger and more
      encompassing host language. It has no grammar of its own; it is a small
      array of words and phrases used under the aegis of some ordinary language
      and in accordance with its grammar. The majority of slang words and
      phrases are in the language already and are merely assigned new slang
      meanings by some subpopulation.&nbsp;<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      The Oakland school board was not endorsing the nonsensical idea that black
      slang should be recognized as a new language. The statement it released
      may have been wordy, diffuse, and filled with bad bureaucratese and
      pompous-sounding references to “African Language Systems,” but the intent
      was clear enough: the board wanted to acknowledge that AAVE was distinct
      in certain respects from Standard English, and it proposed to be
      responsive to the educational implications.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Buried among the jargon of the announcements was a mention of a name for
      AAVE, suggested by a Black scholar in 1975 but never adopted by linguists:
      Ebonics. That word, concocted from <em>ebony</em> (a color term for the
      name of a dark-colored wood) and <em>phonics</em> (the name of a method
      for teaching reading), was destined to attach to the board as if chiseled
      into a block of granite and hung round their necks. They would never hear
      the end of it.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      One problem with the name was that it lent itself irresistibly to stupid
      puns and jokes. The <em>Economist</em> picked it up and printed a brief
      story headed “The Ebonics virus,” a tasteless reference to the then-recent
      outbreak of the horrible Ebola fever in Zaire (the subliminal link: nasty
      things out of Africa). People rapidly invented other -<em>onics</em> words
      to mock the idea of letting African Americans have their own claim to a
      language. Would Jewish people propose that their way of speaking English
      should be designated Hebonics? Could stupid people complain that they were
      victims of their native language, Moronics? Cartoonists seemed to find
      such possibilities endlessly amusing, and the jokes kept coming for more
      than a year.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      But I will not be primarily concerned here with analysis of the politics
      and the rhetoric that the “Ebonics” story provoked. I will be concerned
      with AAVE itself, the everyday speech of millions of people in largely
      segregated African American districts. The majority of English speakers
      think that AAVE is just English with two added factors: some special slang
      terms and a lot of grammatical mistakes. They are simply wrong about
      this.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>LANGUAGE, DIALECTS, AND RULES<br /></h2>

    <p>
      Let me begin by pointing out that there is obviously a difference between
      being an incorrect utterance of one language and being a correct utterance
      in another (perhaps only slightly different). This is obvious when the two
      languages are thoroughly different, like English and French. When a French
      speaker refers to the capital of the United Kingdom as Londres, it isn’t a
      mistake; that’s the correct French name for London. But the same is true
      when we are talking about two very closely related languages. There is a
      strong temptation, especially when one of the two has higher prestige, to
      take one to be the correct way to speak and the other to be incorrect. But
      it is not necessarily so.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I will consider a fairly subtle example involving a grammatical difference
      between two varieties of Standard English. Some speakers, but not all, use
      the word <em>whom</em> instead of <em>who</em> in some contexts. Those who
      do use

      <em>whom</em> always use it after a preposition (“a man in <em>whom</em> I
      have complete confidence”) and may use it after a verb (“And after that
      you visited <em>whom</em>?”), and they may use it at the beginning of a
      sentence (though, “<em>Whom</em> did you visit?” sounds rather stiff, and
      many would avoid it). But most people, even expert writers of English,
      will confess to scratching their heads a little about the following two
      cases:&nbsp;<br />
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        We are talking about a man who everyone seems to think will one day be
        king.
      </li>

      <li>
        We are talking about a man whom everyone seems to think one day will be
        king.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Which version is right? Dimly we may remember something from the grammar
      books about using <em>who</em> for subjects and <em>whom</em> for
      nonsubjects. Can’t we just apply that? No, we can’t. The rule “use
      <em>who</em> for subjects and <em>whom</em> for nonsubjects” is
      insufficiently explicit. These examples involve a relative clause that
      begins after the word <em>man</em>. The next word (<em>who </em>or
      <em>whom</em>) introduces the relative clause (<em
        >everyone seems to think </em
      >__

      <em>will one day be king</em>). There are two things that “subject” might
      mean here: “subject of its clause,” that is, subject of the clause that it
      logically belongs to, or “subject of the relative clause.” The word
      <em>who</em> is logically the subject in a clause that has
      <em>will one day be king</em> as its predicate; if that allows it to count
      as a subject, then version (1) is correct. But the subject of the whole
      relative clause is not <em>who</em> but rather <em>everyone</em>. The word
      <em>who </em>is not the logical subject of that, but just a piece of it.
      If that’s what we mean by being a subject, then we should pick sentence
      (2).<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Where do we turn to decide this point? We look in good manuals of English
      usage. And we immediately find something very interesting: there are clear
      examples of both types in literary works by the best authors. The
      <em>who</em> group—those whose writing suggests that they would plump for
      (1)—includes Arnold Bennett, Charles Dickens, Henry Fielding, and William
      Safire (the <em>New York Times’</em>s language pundit). Good company. But
      the <em>whom</em> group, whose usage shows they would select (2), includes
      early writers like William Caxton and Izaak Walton, famous novelists like
      Charles Kingsley and Rudyard Kipling, romantic poets like John Keats and
      Percy Bysshe Shelley, and at least some

      <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Publishers Weekly</em> writers, together
      with Charles Darwin and William Shakespeare. That, too, is a dream team.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is going on? The answer is that there are two different rules
      involved. Some writers follow one, while others follow the other. The
      members of the <em>who</em> group tacitly assume that <em>who</em> has to
      be the subject of its clause; the members of the <em>whom</em> group
      tacitly assume that <em>who</em> has to be the subject of the relative
      clause.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we have discovered is a division between two
      <em>syntactic dialects</em>—two sectors of the speech community that have
      very slightly different grammars. By assuming that speakers fall into
      these two dialect groups, you can explain both the consistencies of
      practice and the disagreements that occur. The disagreements do not become
      evident very often: only on the rare occasions when <em>who</em> occurs as
      the understood subject of a clause contained in a relative clause without
      being the subject of the relative clause as a whole.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      It is crucially important to notice that people do not just flounder, as
      if they did not know <em>who</em> from <em>whom</em> any more. To describe
      either the <em>who</em> group or the <em>whom</em> group as people who are
      ignorant of the grammar of the language in which they are writing would be
      absurd. More specifically, it would predict quite falsely that you will
      find them blundering into sentences like the follow (the asterisk prefix
      means that the string is not a sentence):<br />
