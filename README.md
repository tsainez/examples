# Machine Learning Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects and code examples that demonstrate my skills and interest in machine learning engineering. The projects here are designed to highlight the end-to-end process of building and deploying machine learning models, from data preprocessing to model compression and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

This repository has been reorganized to focus on machine learning projects. The main directories are:

*   `machine_learning/`: Contains all the showcase machine learning projects.
*   `archive/`: A collection of my previous work in various other programming languages, including C++, Java, and PHP.

## Showcase Projects

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

### 1. MNIST Digit Classifier

*   **Directory:** `machine_learning/mnist_classifier/`
*   **Description:** An end-to-end project that demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a digit classifier on the MNIST dataset. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model training (using a RandomForestClassifier), and prediction.
*   **Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, project structuring.

### 2. Model Compression with the Learning-Compression (LC) Algorithm

*   **Directory:** `machine_learning/model_compression/`
*   **Description:** This project explores advanced model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, and low-rank factorization. It uses the Learning-Compression (LC) algorithm to significantly reduce the size of a neural network while maintaining high accuracy.
*   **Key Skills:** Model optimization, model compression, deep learning, PyTorch.

### 3. Computer Vision Fundamentals

*   **Directory:** `machine_learning/computer_vision/`
*   **Description:** A collection of MATLAB scripts that implement fundamental computer vision algorithms, such as the Harris corner detector and Hough transform. This demonstrates a strong understanding of feature extraction and image processing.
*   **Key Skills:** Computer vision, image processing, feature extraction, MATLAB.
